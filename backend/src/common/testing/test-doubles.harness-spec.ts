 * Test doubles for the collaborator types Nest and Express hand to guards,

 *
 * This file holds the single deliberate unchecked assertion in the test
 * suite support (`asFullType`): a double records only the members a spec
 * drives and is asserted to be the full collaborator type. That is
 * acceptable in tests only — production code always receives real
 * collaborators — which is why the assertion lives here and nowhere else,
 * and why every other helper routes through it. The file uses the
 * `.harness-spec.ts` suffix: it is excluded from the production build and
 * Jest does not run it as a suite of its own.
