-- PostgreSQL has no TTL index. The retention job removes rows past their
-- expiry in small batches and finds them through these indexes. The tables of
-- 0003, 0004, 0008 and 0009 already carry theirs.
--
-- These are plain CREATE INDEX statements inside this file's transaction.
-- Each one blocks writes to its table until the file commits, so sign-in and
-- refresh wait for as long as the build takes. On a database that already
-- holds many sessions, apply this migration with the server stopped.
