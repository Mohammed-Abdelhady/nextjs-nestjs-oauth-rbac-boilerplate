 * the caller's unit of work, so none can commit on its own.
 *
 * Taking a role: once `saveRoleEdit`, `savePendingSweeps` or `removeRole` has
 * returned, no other unit of work can change that role until this one ends. An
 * adapter may take it earlier, at `takeRoleForChange`. A second unit of work
 * that reaches a taken role is refused at once with a retryable abort.
 *
 * Moving holders: once `moveHolders` has returned, no other unit of work can
 * change those accounts' role or session version until this one ends, and a
 * second one that reaches them is refused the same way.
