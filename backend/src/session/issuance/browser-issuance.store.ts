 * read inside that unit of work. A committed authority read, the fresh read a
 * validation makes outside any unit of work, is a different kind of method and
 * issuance has none.
 *
 * Ids are opaque strings. A string this database could not have issued is
 * refused with `MalformedIdError` before anything is read.
 *
 * One sign-in per account at a time: once `markAccountIssuance` has returned,
 * no other unit of work can issue for the account, or change its session
 * version, until this one ends. An adapter may take the account earlier, at
 * `readAccountForIssuance`. A second unit of work that reaches a taken account
 * is refused at once with a retryable abort. It does not wait.
