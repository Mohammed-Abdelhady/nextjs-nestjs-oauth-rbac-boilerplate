/**
 * Test-only rendezvous for forcing a specific interleaving.
 *
 * `RaceGate.hold()` blocks every caller that reaches the gate until `release()`
 * is called; `reached(n)` resolves once `n` callers are held. There are no
 * timers, sleeps or retries, so a test that names an interleaving gets exactly
 * that interleaving on every run.
 *
 * `RaceBarrier` groups gates by a name so a spec can keep its named pause points
 * apart. Neither class imports or reaches into Mongoose; the pause is placed at
 * a seam the spec holds (a spied collaborator or a paused model query).
 *
 * Prefer `holdBefore` on a public service method: that seam outlives a change
 * of database, a paused model query does not.
