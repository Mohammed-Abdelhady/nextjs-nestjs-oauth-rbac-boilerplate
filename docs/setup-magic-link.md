# Magic Link Setup Guide

This guide explains how to turn on passwordless sign-in, where a one-time link mailed to an address replaces the password.

## Overview

A magic link is a token mailed to an address. Following it signs the address holder in, and creates their account if they do not have one yet.

**How a sign-in runs**:

1. The client posts an address to `POST /api/auth/magic-link/request`.
2. The backend stores the sha256 of a fresh token and mails a link to the address.
3. The client page behind that link reads the token out of the query string and posts it to `POST /api/auth/magic-link/verify`.
4. The backend spends the token, sets the session cookie and returns the account.

**What this needs**: a working SMTP configuration. See [setup-smtp.md](setup-smtp.md).

## Turning it on

Add to `backend/.env`:

```bash
# SMTP has to work first
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Magic links
MAGIC_LINK_ENABLED=true
MAGIC_LINK_EXPIRES_IN=900000
MAGIC_LINK_MAX_PER_HOUR=5
```

Left out entirely, `MAGIC_LINK_ENABLED` follows SMTP: links are on when `SMTP_HOST` and `EMAIL_FROM` are both set, and off when either is missing. Set it explicitly to keep the two decisions apart.

`CLIENT_URL` is the origin of the mailed link. A deployment that serves the frontend from `https://app.example.com` has to set it, or links point at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable                  | Description                                | Default                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `MAGIC_LINK_ENABLED`      | Turns the routes on or off                 | on when SMTP is configured |
| `MAGIC_LINK_EXPIRES_IN`   | Link lifetime in milliseconds              | `900000` (15 minutes)      |
| `MAGIC_LINK_MAX_PER_HOUR` | Links mailed to one address per hour       | `5`                        |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED`   | Password register, login, forgot and reset | `true`                     |
| `CLIENT_URL`              | Origin the mailed link points at           | `http://localhost:3000`    |

## Running magic links on their own

Set `AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED=false` alongside `MAGIC_LINK_ENABLED=true`. `POST /api/auth/register`, `/login`, `/forgot-password` and `/reset-password` then answer `404` with the error code `FEATURE_DISABLED`, and `GET /api/auth/methods` reports `password: false`, so a client built against that endpoint stops rendering the password form.

Activation, resend and logout stay open. An activation code also confirms an address an administrator moved an account to, which has nothing to do with passwords.

Accounts created by a magic link have no password hash. They can request a password later through the reset flow, if password sign-in is on. Accounts that have a password can also sign in with a link; the two methods do not exclude each other.

## Routes

### Request a link

```http
POST /api/auth/magic-link/request
Content-Type: application/json

{ "email": "user@example.com" }
```

Answers `200` with the same body for an address with an account, an address without one, and an address that has already hit the hourly cap:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "email": "user@example.com" },
  "message": "If the address can sign in, a link has been sent"
}
```

Rate limited to 5 requests per 15 minutes per caller, on top of the per-address hourly cap.

### Spend a link

```http
POST /api/auth/magic-link/verify
Content-Type: application/json

{ "token": "<token from the query string>" }
```

Answers `200` with the account and sets the session cookie:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "user",
      "role": "user",
      "authProvider": "email",
      "isVerified": true,
      "permissions": ["users:read"]
    }
  },
  "message": "Login successful"
}
```

A token that is unknown, already spent, expired, or belongs to a deleted account answers `400` with `MAGIC_LINK_INVALID`. There is one error code on purpose: telling "expired" apart from "never existed" tells a caller which addresses have pending links.

### List sign-in methods

```http
GET /api/auth/methods
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "methods": {
      "password": true,
      "magicLink": true,
      "oauth": [{ "id": "google", "displayName": "Google" }]
    }
  }
}
```

## The client page behind the link

The mailed link points at `${CLIENT_URL}/auth/magic-link/verify?token=...`, not at the backend. That page reads the token and posts it.

The indirection is the point. Mail scanners, link preview services and some clients fetch every URL in a message before a person sees it. A backend route that signs a caller in on a plain `GET` is spent by the first of those fetches, and the account holder gets an error. A `POST` that a page makes after it loads is not something a scanner issues.

For the same reason there is no `GET /api/auth/magic-link/verify`.

## What the backend stores

The `pendingmagiclinks` collection:

| Field        | Notes                                                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `email`      | Lowercased address the link was mailed to                                     |
| `tokenHash`  | sha256 of the token, hex, unique. The token itself is mailed and never stored |
| `expiresAt`  | When the link stops working                                                   |
| `consumedAt` | Set by the request that spends the link, `null` before that                   |
| `requestIp`  | Address the request came from                                                 |
| `userAgent`  | Agent string of the request                                                   |

A TTL index removes each record an hour after it expires. The delay is deliberate: the per-address hourly cap counts records created in the last hour, so they have to outlive the link.

Spending a link is a single `findOneAndUpdate` on `{ tokenHash, consumedAt: null }`. Two requests carrying the same token cannot both win it.

## Troubleshooting

### Every request answers 404 with FEATURE_DISABLED

Magic links are off. Check `MAGIC_LINK_ENABLED`, and check `SMTP_HOST` and `EMAIL_FROM` when you left it unset. `GET /api/auth/methods` reports what the running process resolved.

### The request answers 200 but no mail arrives

The reply is the same whether or not a link was mailed, so start with the logs. `Magic link sent to ...` means the mail was handed to SMTP; `Magic link hourly cap reached for ...` means the address is over `MAGIC_LINK_MAX_PER_HOUR`; `Magic link request for a deleted account` means the account is soft-deleted and nothing was mailed.

A `400` with `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED` means SMTP rejected the message. See the troubleshooting section of [setup-smtp.md](setup-smtp.md).

Watch the order while SMTP is broken: the pending record is written before the mail goes out, so five failed sends use up `MAGIC_LINK_MAX_PER_HOUR` for that address. Further requests then answer `200` and mail nothing until the hour passes. Fix SMTP first, then wait out the window or clear the address from `pendingmagiclinks`.

### The link opens the client but sign-in fails with MAGIC_LINK_INVALID

Either the link is older than `MAGIC_LINK_EXPIRES_IN`, or the token was already spent. Something fetching the link ahead of the account holder cannot spend it, since only a `POST` does, but a page that posts the token twice can. Post once per page load.

### Links point at localhost in production

`CLIENT_URL` is unset in the backend environment.

### Sign-in works but the session cookie is missing

The cookie is `SameSite=strict`, and `Secure` in production. The client and the API have to be same-site, and production needs HTTPS. This is the same requirement password sign-in has.

## Production Notes

- Keep `MAGIC_LINK_EXPIRES_IN` short. Fifteen minutes is the default; an hour is the outside limit worth considering, because a mailbox someone else reaches later is the main risk here.
- `MAGIC_LINK_MAX_PER_HOUR` caps how much mail one address can be made to receive. Raise it only if account holders genuinely request several links per hour.
- Use a dedicated transactional mail provider. A link that lands in spam is a sign-in that fails.
- Watch the `Magic link hourly cap reached` warnings. A run of them on one address means someone is using the request route to bombard a mailbox.
